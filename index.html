  <h1>National Income of Countries</h1>
  <p>Looking at the national income of the countries,</p>
  <ul>
    <li>highest national income: United States</li>
    <li>second most high national income: Germany and South Korea</li>
    <li>national income in China: approximately $10,000</li>
    <li>autonomous regions within China (Hong Kong and Macau) have national income values that are 3-4 times higher than China</li>
    <li>after the Covid pandemic, a loss of half in national income values is observed in Macau</li>
  </ul>
  <p>These are the data obtained from local news sites due to pressure to force closures.</p>
  <p>The highest national income values are seen in these countries. Reasons...</p>
  <p>Looking at the countries with the lowest national income, Turkey, Mexico, China and Russia.</p>
  <p>China's low income is despite the fact that its autonomous regions have increased national income in these regions with its unique management and methods and high technology in these regions can produce.</p>
  <p>Related to North Korea, national income and data on Pyongyang cities is not available. North Korea does not share this data with the World Bank, but does share unemployment data with the bank. Accordingly, the lowest unemployment value is seen in North Korea. However, the accuracy of unemployment data in North Korea is not clear according to a study by Lee, Suk of the Development Institute.</p>
  <p>Looking at the unemployment data, the lowest unemployment rates are seen in countries with the highest national income. The probable reason for this is the high amount of capital in these countries, which causes new employment by channeling investments in various fields. The number of immigrants has no bearing on unemployment in countries where unemployment is high, and unemployment is partially lower in those countries.</p>
